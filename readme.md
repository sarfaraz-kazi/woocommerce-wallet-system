I've created a complete WooCommerce wallet system plugin that meets all your requirements. Here's what the plugin includes:

## Features Implemented:

1. **Wallet Balance Storage**: Each user has a meta field `_wallet_balance` to store their current wallet balance
2. **Payment Gateway**: Wallet appears as a payment option during checkout
3. **Balance Validation**: Only allows payment if wallet balance ≥ order total (no partial payments)
4. **Admin Interface**: Wallet balance field added to user profile pages in WP Admin
5. **User Dashboard**: Wallet balance displayed on customer account dashboard

## Key Components:

### Main Class (`WC_Simple_Wallet_System`)
- Manages wallet balance operations
- Handles user profile integration
- Provides helper methods for balance management

### Payment Gateway Class (`WC_Wallet_Payment_Gateway`)
- Extends WooCommerce's payment gateway framework
- Validates wallet balance before showing as available
- Processes payments by deducting from wallet

## Edge Cases Handled:

1. **Insufficient Balance**: Gateway only appears if balance ≥ order total
2. **Non-logged Users**: Wallet payment unavailable for guests
3. **Negative Balances**: Prevents wallet balance from going below zero
4. **Invalid Users**: Handles cases where user ID is invalid/empty
5. **Transaction Safety**: Validates balance again during payment processing
6. **Currency Consistency**: Uses store's default currency throughout

## Installation Instructions:

1. Upload plugin folder to `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through WordPress admin
3. The plugin will automatically:
   - Add wallet balance (0.00) to all existing users
   - Set up the payment gateway
   - Add admin fields for balance management

## Usage:

1. **Admin**: Go to Users → Edit User → Wallet Information to set/update balances
2. **Customers**: View balance on My Account dashboard
3. **Checkout**: Wallet payment appears only when balance is sufficient

The code is clean, well-documented, and follows WordPress/WooCommerce coding standards. It includes proper sanitization, validation, and error handling throughout.
